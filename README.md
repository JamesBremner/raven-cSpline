raven-cSpline
=============

A 2D cubic spline class.  Calculates the coefficients of the spline curves through some points.  Calculates Y value for an arbitrary X point.  Calls a user provided function to draw the spline curves.

The spline curve through the points

```
0, 100
1, 50
2, -100
3, 50
4, 200
```
